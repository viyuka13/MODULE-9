# # ➖ Matrix Operations-Matrix Subtraction in Python

## 🎯 AIM:
To write a Python program that reads two matrices from the user and performs matrix subtraction.

---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM:

1. **Start**
2. Create variables `r` and `c` for rows and columns
3. Get the values of `r` and `c` from the user
4. Define a function `create_matrix(n, m)` to:
   - Prompt user for each matrix element
   - Append each row to form a complete matrix
5. Call the `create_matrix()` function twice to read two matrices `A` and `B`
6. Define a loop to subtract the elements of matrix `B` from matrix `A`
7. Store the result in a new matrix `C`
8. Print the resulting matrix `C`
9. **Stop**

## 💻 PROGRAM:
      r = int(input())
      c = int(input())
      
      def create_matrix(n, m):
          matrix = []
          for _ in range(n):
              row = list(map(int, input().split()))
              matrix.append(row)
          return matrix
      
      A = create_matrix(r, c)
      B = create_matrix(r, c)
      
      C = [[A[i][j] - B[i][j] for j in range(c)] for i in range(r)]
      
      for row in C:
          print(*row)

## RESULT:
The program successfully demonstrates matrix subtraction using user-defined input and outputs the result in matrix format.
